Head GSI + Content TA

Hello there! I'm a 5th Year MS student under Prof. Sastry, particularly interested in merging classical and learning-based control. I was an undergrad here double majoring in EECS and Business. Outside of class, I love reading, traveling (and meeting new people, including y'all!), art, basketball, photography, design, and public policy, particularly designing systems to influence social change.
