Lab UGSI

As a digital artist trying to get into physical art, I really appreciated how 106a labs were able to nurture my skills and give me the confidence to branch out and explore. Whether you choose to paint, watercolor, or cast liquid metal, I hope that Eclectically Elegant Caricature Studies can grant you the same passion and fulfillment as I did in exploring and developing my art style.
