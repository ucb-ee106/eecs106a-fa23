Lab Assistant

Hi! I’m Anuj, a senior majoring in Bioengineering minoring in EECS. I’m interested in the application of robotics to healthcare, particularly surgical robotics. In my free time, I’m usually watching/playing basketball, playing Overwatch, or hanging out with friends! I’m excited to help teach 106A this semester!
