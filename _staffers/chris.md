Lab Assistant

I'm a senior majoring in EECS. My research is centered on real-time perception systems for high-speed vehicles, part of the ROAR lab's Indy Autonomous Challenge team. That aside, I love cats, am an avid badminton player, and have recently found bouldering pretty fun. If you're keen on discussing research opportunities, feel free to catch me around!
