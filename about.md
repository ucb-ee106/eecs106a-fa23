## Class Description
This course is an introduction to the field of robotics. It covers the fundamentals of kinematics, dynamics, control of robot manipulators, robotic vision, and sensing. The course deals with forward and inverse kinematics of serial chain manipulators, the manipulator Jacobian, force relations, dynamics, and control. It presents elementary principles on computer vision and robot motion planning. The course concludes with current applications of robotics in active perception, medical robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other areas.

The lectures are supplemented with homeworks and experimental work in the laboratory using several <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer/">Sawyer</a> and <a href="http://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot2/">TurtleBot</a> robots. There are two midterms but no final exam. The last month of the course is devoted to the design and implementation of a final project, carried out in groups of approximately four students.

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have taken EECS C106A / BioE C106A / ME C106A / EECS C206A or an equivalent course. A strong programming background, knowledge of Python and Matlab, and some coursework in feedback controls (such as EE C128 / ME C134) are also useful. Those who have not taken EECS C106A / BioE C106A / ME C106A / EECS C206A should have a strong programming background, knowledge of Python and Matlab, and exposure to linear algebra, Lagrangian dynamics, and feedback controls at the intermediate level. Please speak to a member of course staff if you are interested in taking the class without the prerequisites.

## Desired Course Outcomes
The primary objective of this course is to help students develop the academic maturity necessary to understand and conduct research in the field of robotics, vision, and intelligent machines. Along with surveying a breadth of topics relevant to modern robotics, this course also gives students the ability to implement the concepts taught in lecture through exploratory lab-based projects. Students will get practice reading and interpreting research papers through weekly paper presentations. The course culminates in a final project that allows students to conduct independent, original research on a topic of their choosing. Students who complete EECS 106B/206B should:
- Be proficient at reading, comprehending, critiquing, and reimplementing research papers in the field of robotics.
- Have experience conducting independent research in model-based robotics, vision and intelligent machines.
- Have the tools necessary to reason about nonlinear control systems, robotic manipulators, steering systems subject to non-holonomy, path-planning, active vision, image reconstruction, active vision, robotic grasping, and other advances in robotics.

Please see the homepage for a weekly breakdown of topics.
